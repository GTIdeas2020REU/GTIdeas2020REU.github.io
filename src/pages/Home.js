            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p className='biotext'> The COV-IDEAS REU was formed by various faculty across the country, joined together to mentor eight undergraduate students for a remote opportunity for summer research. Students work closely with faculty mentors on an original COVID-19 related research project, over a 10-week period. The two projects
            included in the program are the Aggregators and Model Projects. They gain experience in developing the project, collecting data, and analyzing the results.
            In addition to the additional projects, students attend weekly seminars with topics such as reading a scientific paper or workshops on different technologies.
              </p>
            <p className='biotext'> The topical focus of the projects are on forecasting, prediction markets, machine learning and mathematical modelling. At the end of the program,
            the individual projects will be showcased and published for all to see. </p>

            <h3>GT IDEAS Lab</h3>
            <p className='biotext'>The Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) provides a unified point to connect government, industry, and academia to advance foundational research, and accelerate the adoption of Big Data technology.
