Abernethy's primary interest is in Machine Learning, with a particular focus in sequential decision making, online learning, online algorithms and adversarial learning models.\n</p>\n          </Col>\n          <br></br><br></br>\n          <Col xs={12} sm={12} smOffset={2}>\n            \n            <h1 className='leftnamestyle'>Bo Waggoner</h1>\n            <h5 className='leftnamestyle'><i>Professor</i></h5>\n            <p className='leftnamestyle'>Bo is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

We'll send him to Washington. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Be brave. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.\n            Anyone can paint. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.<br></br><br></br>\n            That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.\n            You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. That's crazy. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.</p>\n          </Col>\n        </Container>\n        <br></br><br></br>\n\n\n        <h1 style={{backgroundColor:'gray'}}>Students</h1>\n        <br></br>\n        <Container>\n          <Row>\n            <Col>\n            \n            <h1 >Rachel Ombok</h1>\n            <h5 ><i>BSc Computer Science, Minor in Game Engineering, Class of 2022</i></h5>\n            <p >Rachel studies Computer Science and Game Engineering at New York University, class of 2022. \n              Alongside that, she is interested in game development, AR/VR technologies, and artificial intelligence. \n              Rachel works on the Aggregator Project where she helps build the COVID-19 forecasting site and aggregate relevant data relating to the pandemic.\n</p>\n            </Col>\n            <Col>\n            \n            <h1 >Sarah Yoo</h1>\n            <h5 ><i>Computer Science, Class of 2022</i></h5>\n            <p >Sarah studies computer science with a concentration in people and intelligence at Georgia Tech. \n              She has a strong interest in web development, back-end development, and data science. \n              Sarah works on the Aggregator project where she helps build a website that aggregates COVID-19 forecasts and crowd-sources relevant predictions to provide a more accurate projection of the pandemic. \n </p>\n            </Col>\n            <Col>\n            \n            <h1 >Aniruddha Murali</h1>\n            <h5 ><i>Computer Science, Class of 2022</i></h5>\n            <p>Aniruddha studies computer science, concentrating in artificial intelligence, modeling, and simulations at Georgia Tech.
